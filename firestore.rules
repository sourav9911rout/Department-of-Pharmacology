/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset implements a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model
 * for a departmental hub application. The core principle is that all data creation, modification,
 * and deletion are restricted to users with administrative privileges. General authenticated
 * users are granted read-only access to view departmental data like inventory, requirements,
 * and schedules.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into several top-level collections:
 * - /procured_items: A list of all items procured by the department.
 * - /requirements: A list of departmental needs, with nested subcollections for primary and secondary items.
 * - /class_meetings: A schedule of upcoming classes and meetings.
 * - /documents: Links to important documents.
 * - /roles_admin: A special collection used solely for authorization lookups.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin-Only Writes: All write operations (create, update, delete) on core data collections
 *   are universally restricted to admin users.
 * - Read-Only for Authenticated Users: Any user who is signed in can read data from the
 *   `procured_items`, `requirements`, `class_meetings`, and `documents` collections. This supports the
 *   application's function as an informational hub.
 * - Server-Managed Roles: The `/roles_admin` collection, which grants admin rights, is locked
 *   down from all client-side access. It is intended to be managed exclusively via a secure
 *   backend environment (e.g., Cloud Functions with the Admin SDK). This prevents users
 *   from escalating their own privileges.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: Admin roles are denormalized into the `/roles_admin/{userId}`
 * collection. A user is considered an admin if a document with their UID exists in this collection.
 * This allows for a fast, efficient `exists()` check in security rules, avoiding slow and costly
 * `get()` calls for every write operation.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Each primary data type has its own top-level collection, which
 * simplifies rule application.
